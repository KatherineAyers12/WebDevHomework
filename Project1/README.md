# My First README.md
## Katherine Ayers
This class up to this point has been a very good *reminder* for everything. I already have used atom before but it's nice to have a **refresher** and someone else's suggestions for packages and themes. I've used a tiny bit of  `Markdown` before but have mainly used `JS`. I'm excited for this class. I'm excited to learn
1. How to code for webpages
2. how to make lists like these
    * But also
  1. make different lists
  2. and learn more about markdown
