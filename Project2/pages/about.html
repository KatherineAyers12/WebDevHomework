  <p class = "project-description" id = "project-description">
    The base of this project is an instructable recipe. I chose this because it seemed the best way to make a project like this.
    I chose this recipe in particular because I had made it the morning that I had chose it, so when it came time to choose a recipe
    it just made sense to use that one. </p>

    <h2 class = "about"> The Process</h2>
    <p class = "process-description" id ="process-descriptions">
      The process for this project as a whole was interesting. I found the first part incredibly easy, I had done things like it before
      but the second part, for some reason was just harder. I had a hard time with it and did not meet all the requirements, but <thead>
      third part has been overall better and easier to take in. </p>

      <h2 class = "about"> What I learned</h2>
      <p class = "what-i-learned" id = "what-i-learned">
        Overall in this project I learned alot. I learned how to make seperate pages and link to them, certain styling aspects of html
        I also learned most about this page in particular, mostly with the divs and id's. It was a fair project, I think.
