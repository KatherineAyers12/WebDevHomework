I started this project thinking out colors and otherwise with sketches. I didn't end up keeping these original sketches, I didn't feel like I needed to in the end, I ended up spending more time on the colors and trying to get the sizes correct. Here are the original sketches though

I started doing this project trying to do everything at one time, which was a mistake. I ended up redoing it completely and starting with just being able to apply the css stylesheet. I don't know why, but I have a hard time just doing that. After that it was a matter of deciding how to do the responsive web design. So at this moment I have something that works ok in that realm, but i'm still working on the css portion of the homework.
