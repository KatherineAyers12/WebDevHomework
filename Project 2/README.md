#README for Recipe
##Katherine Ayers
I guess to start I got my recipe from [this site](http://damndelicious.net/2016/01/07/slow-cooker-tomato-kale-and-quinoa-soup/)
This project wasn't necessarily difficult for me, it just required sitting down and acutally doing it. I chose my recipe because it's actually something I made that morning, and it seemed to work well for this project. I found it difficult to use certain aspects of code that were required for this project. I didn't end up using strike through, delete, or subscript because there was never a need for this in the recipe. So those didn't get used. I had a difficult time with style, I implemented yet but it never appeared, so perhaps it was incorrect. Overall this project was fun and I had a good time.
