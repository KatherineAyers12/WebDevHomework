<h1> About J.K. Rowling </h1>
 <div class="text-block"
<p>Born in Yate, England, on July 31, 1965, J.K. Rowling came from humble
  economic means before writing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a
  children's fantasy novel. The work was an international hit and Rowling wrote six more books in the series,
  which sold hundreds of millions of copies and was adapted into a blockbuster film franchise. In 2012, Rowling
  released the novel The Casual Vacancy.
